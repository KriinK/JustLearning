<!--Learning from ZERO (again)
Typing "<!DOCTYPE html-5>" will create
automatically the html basic tags.
But I will learn each one-->

<!DOCTYPE html5>

<html lang="pt-BR"> <!-- Begin of our site -->
  <head> <!-- Site non-seen configurations -->
    <!-- meta is a tag to set a lot of metadata to our site -->
    <meta charset="utf-8"> <!-- It says what kinda symbols and characters our site will be able to show (utf-8 englobe all symbols or almost, at least) -->
    <meta name="author" content="Juan Evangelista">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- Load our css file -->
  </head>
  
  <body> <!-- All visible content of our site -->
    
    <script src="main.js">
      //We can also write JavaScript inside here
      //Highly recommended to put at the body's end to load all html content before JavaScript's code 
    </script> <!-- Load our javascript file-->
  </body>
  
</html> <!-- End of our site -->
